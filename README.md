# FoodWaste
### About
I'm tired of forgetting about food and tossing it in the garbage when I find it a week later and it's all rotten and inedible. 

### Goals for this App

- [ ] Make a basic pantry so users can see what food items they have. Main Pantry will be a dictionary of items and expiration dates.
- [ ] Make a notification so user is reminded to eat food 
- [ ] Use vision to easily add items to a pantry
- [ ] Make a model with common ranges for food types to start with
- [ ] Make a moving average to recalculate when food will go bad if the item is thrown away before eating
